# When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?

## Project Description

In this project, you'll analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. You'll search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and you'll explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

## Project Tasks
- The ten best-selling video games
- Missing review scores
- Years that video game critics loved
